This project, developed as part of the Themed Entertainment Association (TEA) at UCSD, focuses on designing and building an animatronic figure that enhances themed attractions through innovative storytelling and technology.



## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to design and implement an interactive animatronic character that integrates:

Motion Control: Using servo motor actuators for lifelike movement.

Audio Integration: Synchronizing mouth with real time audio input.

Energy Efficiency & Durability: Ensuring sustainability and long-term reliability in a production setting.
